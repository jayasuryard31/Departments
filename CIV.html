The department offers a full time B.E degree course in Civil Engineering. Our department organizes seminars, workshops & Industrial visits for the benefit of students and faculty which would bring exposure of the recent trend in civil engineering. Students involve in the consultancy projects obtained through various govt. and non-govt. agencies.

                  The infrastructure available in the department facilitates students to develop their skill and knowledge within the framework of curriculum prescribed by the Visvesvaraya Technological University.
                  
                  Our vision is to make every student a better engineer having excellence in education, entrepreneurship & innovation along with qualities like high ethical standards, integrity & credibility. Fifth Sem Civil Engineering students secured the highest results, 95.08% in VTU examination held during Dec/Jan 2011 amongst the colleges in Dakshina Kannada region. We are committed to set up a centre of excellence by offering quality technical education and providing research opportunities in civil engineering and making our students technically the best and ethically strong.</p>
